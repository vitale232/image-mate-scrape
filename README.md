# Image Mate Scraper

New York State tax assessors point residents to [Image Mate online](https://cityofglensfalls.sdgnys.com/index.aspx).
The site is very slow, the queries don't seem to listen, and the UI is brutal to look at.
To make better use of this data, I've saved the pages I needed and wrote
this little script to pull the data out into a separate CSV file.
